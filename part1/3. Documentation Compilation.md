## 🔹 High-Level Architecture

### 🏗 Overview
HBnB follows a **layered architecture** to ensure **separation of concerns, maintainability, and scalability**. The key layers include:

- **📌 Presentation Layer**: Manages user interactions through a web interface or API endpoints.
- **📌 Business Logic Layer**: Implements application rules and processes user requests.
- **📌 Data Access Layer**: Manages database interactions and persistence.
- **📌 Infrastructure Layer**: Provides support for caching, authentication, and security.

### 📊 High-Level Package Diagram

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class PresentationLayer {
        <<Interface>>
        +ServiceAPI
        +handleRequests()
    }

    class BusinessLogicLayer {
        +User
        +Place
        +Review
        +Amenity
        +FacadeService
        +processLogic()
    }

    class PersistenceLayer {
        +DatabaseAccess
        +saveData()
        +retrieveData()
    }

    PresentationLayer --> BusinessLogicLayer : Facade Pattern
    BusinessLogicLayer --> PersistenceLayer : Database Operations
```

### 📌 Explanation

- **Presentation Layer**: RESTful API for interacting with the application.
- **Business Logic Layer**: Core classes handling business logic.
- **Data Access Layer**: Ensures efficient and secure data storage and retrieval.
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Auxiliary services such as authentication and security.

### 📊 Class Diagram

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class User {
        +UUID id
        +string first_name
        +string last_name
        +string email
        +string password
        +bool is_admin
        +datetime created_at
        +datetime updated_at
        +Place[] places
        +Review[] reviews
        +register()
        +update_profile()
        +delete_account()
    }

    class Place {
        +UUID id
        +string title
        +string description
        +float price
        +float latitude
        +float longitude
        +User owner
        +Amenity[] amenities
        +Review[] reviews
        +datetime created_at
        +datetime updated_at
        +create()
        +update()
        +delete()
        +list_places()
    }

    class Review {
        +UUID id
        +User reviewer
        +Place place
        +int rating
        +string comment
        +datetime created_at
        +datetime updated_at
        +create()
        +update()
        +delete()
        +list_by_place()
    }

    class Amenity {
        +UUID id
        +string name
        +string description
        +datetime created_at
        +datetime updated_at
        +create()
        +update()
        +delete()
        +list_amenities()
    }

    User "1" --> "*" Place : owns
    User "1" --> "*" Review : writes
    Place "1" --> "*" Review : has
    Place "1" --> "*" Amenity : offers
```

### 🔑 Key Entities and Their Relationships
- **User**: Represents individuals interacting with the application.
- **Place**: Defines rental properties and their attributes.
- **Review**: Captures user-generated feedback.
- **Amenity**: Lists available amenities for a property.

### 📌 Design Considerations
- **Use of inheritance** for common attributes.
- **Encapsulation** ensures secure data access.
- **Associations** represent real-world relationships.
